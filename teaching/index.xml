&lt;li>Nice guy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Best TA I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Honestly such a great TA. He also had many office hours which I know helped many students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amazing explanations and examples - thanks a lot!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He spends his time with you when you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand something. If you needed additional understanding he would explain it in different ways. I never felt &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; when trying to learn from him, which makes me comfortable&lt;/li>

&lt;li>visualization of concepts, patience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good at explaining things.&lt;/li>
